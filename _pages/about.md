Hello/Namaste,

I am an applied researcher, data scientist and AI engineer with broad experience in the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Time-Series. Currently, I hold the position of Staff AI Engineer at GE Healthcare. 

I hold an M.S (by reasearch) degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-Madras) wherein I was advised by [Prof. Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~mohan/index.html) and [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/). During my masters, I was involved in research across areas such as Computational Photography, Computer Vision, Medical Image Analysis, etc., and was also collaborating with an R&D organization called [Healthcare Technology Research Centre (HTIC)](https://www.hticiitm.org/) tackling various medical domain problems using ML/DL/AI.

Prior to that, I was a junior research fellow at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) working in the fields of Medical Imaging, Image Processing and Inverse Problems such as Image Reconstruction.
